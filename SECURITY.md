# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains a **normative reference** (GTAF – Governance & Trust Architecture Framework).
It does **not** contain executable software, services, or runtime components.

Accordingly, “security issues” in this context do **not** refer to vulnerabilities in code execution,
but to potential risks arising from **misleading guidance, structural ambiguity, or governance loopholes**
that could reasonably lead to unsafe delegation, loss of accountability, or misuse in downstream systems.

---

## What to Report

Please report issues that may have **security relevance at the governance or decision-architecture level**, including for example:

- Ambiguous or misleading normative statements
- Structural inconsistencies between artifacts
- Gaps that could enable responsibility evasion or unsafe delegation
- Conflicts between stated constraints and implied system behavior
- Errors that materially affect trust, authority, or accountability boundaries

Purely editorial issues (typos, formatting, wording suggestions) should be reported via regular Issues instead.

---

## How to Report

Security-relevant concerns should be reported via **private disclosure**.

Please use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature for this repository,
or contact the maintainers directly if instructed to do so in an official publication context.

Public disclosure via Issues or Pull Requests is discouraged until the matter has been reviewed.

---

## Review & Handling

Reported issues will be reviewed by the GTAF maintainers.

Depending on scope and impact, a resolution may involve:
- Clarification or correction in a subsequent revision
- Explicit documentation of constraints or non-goals
- Formal errata or versioned update of the reference

There is no guaranteed response time, but all reports are taken seriously.

---

## Non-Goals

This repository does **not** operate a bug bounty program.
No monetary rewards are offered for disclosures.

The purpose of this policy is to preserve the **integrity, safety, and trustworthiness**
of the GTAF reference as a public normative artifact.
