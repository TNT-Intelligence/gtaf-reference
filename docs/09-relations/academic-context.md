# Academic Context

This page provides GTAF’s academic anchors. It complements the standards/frameworks positioning in [Related Work / Theoretical Anchor](../09-relations/relation-to-existing-frameworks/).

## Agency Theory (Principal-Agent)
**Core idea:** when authority is delegated, information asymmetries and misaligned incentives create agency costs; formal structures are needed to control them.

**Relevance to GTAF:** GTAF treats delegations (especially to autonomous systems) as a principal–agent problem. DR defines permissible decision space; RB defines outcome ownership; DRC ensures delegation is structurally controlled and reviewable—reducing agency costs introduced by opaque automation.

## The Responsibility Gap (learning systems and accountability)
**Core idea:** learning automata can act in ways not predictable or reasonably foreseeable by their operators, creating a responsibility gap where traditional attribution fails.

**Relevance to GTAF:** GTAF’s RB and DRC semantics are designed to prevent responsibility gaps from becoming operational reality: outcome ownership remains anchored, and delegation is permitted only if boundaries, escalation, and intervention reachability are explicit and evidenced.

## Sensemaking (Weick)
**Core idea:** organizations make sense of ambiguity and complexity through interpretive processes; structure shapes what can be understood and acted upon.

**Relevance to GTAF:** GTAF treats artifacts as **normative reality**: they stabilize meaning in complex systems so decision authority, boundaries, and ownership are not continuously renegotiated under stress.

## Safety as Control (STPA / STAMP)
**Core idea:** accidents in complex socio‑technical systems arise from inadequate control and unsafe interactions; STPA frames safety as a control problem and emphasizes constraints on component interactions.

**Relevance to GTAF:** GTAF is structurally compatible with safety‑as‑control thinking: SB/DR define constraints, EIS provides a control override, DRB provides periodic validation, and DVM acts as early warning for structural decay. GTAF adapts this logic to delegation and governance, not classical safety engineering certification.
