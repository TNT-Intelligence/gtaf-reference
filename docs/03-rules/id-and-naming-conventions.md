# ID and Naming Conventions

Stable IDs are required for referential integrity. IDs must not be reused for different objects.

## Artifact IDs (recommended)
- SB-### (System Boundary)
- DR-#### (Decision Record)
- RB-### (Responsibility Binding)
- DRC-### (Readiness Check)
- DRB-### (Review Board)
- EIS-### (Intervention System)
- DVM-### (Velocity Metrics)

## Other IDs
- CLAIM-### (Conformity claims)
- E-<category><number> (Event codes)
- EVID-### (Evidence references)

IDs MUST be stable over time. Revisions are tracked separately.
