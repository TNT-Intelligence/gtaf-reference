# Application Guardrails

GTAF defines **structural prerequisites** for delegation. The application phase must not drift into implementation or marketing.

## What must not happen in this phase (normative guardrails)
Any work package that drifts into the following must be rejected or split into a future effort:

- implementation
- tooling selection or buildout
- website/marketing content
- certification processes

## What this phase must deliver
- Purpose, scope, and non‑goals are fixed.
- Five‑pillar method is defined and followed.
- Artifact types, relations, and [invariants](../03-rules/invariants/) are normatively described.
- GTAF remains explainable and scope‑bound without delivery dependency.
