# Non-adoption and Scope Reduction

GTAF rules are **non‑negotiable**. If prerequisites are not satisfied, delegation is **NOT_PERMITTED**.

## Normative implications
- If required artifacts are missing or invalid, [DRC](../02-artifacts/delegation-readiness-check/) cannot be PERMITTED.
- If boundaries, mandates, or roles are unclear, delegation must not proceed.
- If scope changes, revalidation is mandatory before delegation continues.

## Practical consequence
If a domain cannot meet requirements, the correct response is **to avoid delegation in that scope** until structure and evidence are restored.
