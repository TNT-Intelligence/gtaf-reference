# Validity and Revalidation

## Validity windows
Artifacts and claims are valid only within their windows. Expiry invalidates readiness.

## Revalidation triggers (normative)
- SB boundary expansion or interface widening
- DR boundary or impact change
- Delegation level change
- Mandate/authority change
- Scope split/merge or precedence change
- Evidence expiration or reachability failure
- Reference MAJOR version adoption

Any trigger in a scope with semi‑autonomous delegation MUST cause DRC reissuance.
