# Roadmap

The normative reference does not define a public roadmap. Reference evolution is handled via controlled change records and versioned releases.

## Research / Future Direction (non-binding)
The following is explicitly **not** part of the current normative reference and is provided only as a possible future research direction:
- **Formal Core Consistency Check**: a minimal formal model (SB/DR/RB/DRC + invariants + DRC decision logic) that can be verified for internal consistency using a constraint solver or model checker.

This would be maintained outside the normative text and linked as an optional technical appendix.
