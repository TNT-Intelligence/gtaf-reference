# v0.1

This is the initial **normative reference baseline** for GTAF.

See: [Versioning & Change Control](../11-versions/versioning-and-change-control.md).

## Scope of this release
v0.1 defines the initial normative structure:

- Core artifacts (SB/DR/RB/DRC) and lifecycle artifacts (DRB/EIS/DVM)
- Claims & conformance rules
- Scope model and invariants
- Risk classes and minimum requirements

## Compatibility expectations
Artifacts and claims that bind to `GTAF-0.1` are valid only within their scope and validity windows.  
Future versions may introduce breaking changes; see [Versioning & Change Control](../11-versions/versioning-and-change-control.md).
