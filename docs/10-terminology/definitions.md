- Autonomous

## Reachability
Practical ability to activate escalation or intervention within time‑to‑harm constraints.

## Evidence

## PERMITTED vs NOT_PERMITTED
A DRC is PERMITTED only if required artifacts exist, are valid, and evidence/reachability requirements are met. Any missing prerequisite yields NOT_PERMITTED.
