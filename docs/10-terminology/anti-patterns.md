# Anti-Patterns

- Claims without scope/version/time window
- DRC issued based on trust rather than artifacts
- Kill‑switch defined without reachability evidence
- SB defined without included/excluded components
- RB missing for semi‑autonomous delegation
- Renewing claims without reissuing DRC
- Continuing delegation in EXPIRING/INVALIDATED states
- Treating EIS as optional in Class C
