# Non-goals

GTAF **does not**:

- Build or operate customer infrastructure
- Provide managed services
- Implement tools, platforms, pipelines, or IaC repos
- Issue compliance labels, certificates, or maturity scores
- Act as a generic consulting or transformation methodology

GTAF is a **responsibility and control framework**, not an execution model.
