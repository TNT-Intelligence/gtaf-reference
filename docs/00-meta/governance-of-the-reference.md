The normative reference is stewarded by **TNT Intelligence GmbH i.G.**.

## Change classes
- **MAJOR**: breaking normative change
- **MINOR**: additive or clarifying change
- **PATCH**: editorial, non-semantic change

## Artifact lifecycle states
Artifacts MUST use the lifecycle states:

- DRAFT
- ACTIVE
- DEPRECATED
- RETIRED

## Deprecation
Deprecated definitions MUST include:

- reason
- successor reference
- sunset date

## Reference Change Records (RCR)
Changes should be recorded as a structured change log entry including rationale, impacted artifacts, and migration notes.
