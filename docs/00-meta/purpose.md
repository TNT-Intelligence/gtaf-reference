# Purpose

This reference defines the **normative structure** of GTAF. GTAF exists to make delegation and responsibility in complex systems **explicit, verifiable, and time-bound** using structured [artifacts](/10-terminology/glossary/#artifact) rather than narrative explanation.

## Primary goals
- Provide **clear, non-negotiable definitions** for GTAF artifacts and their relationships.
- Enable **binary delegation readiness** via the [DRC](/02-artifacts/delegation-readiness-check/).
- Preserve **scope-bound interpretability** through [reference versioning](/01-core-model/claims-and-conformance/) and [validity windows](/10-terminology/glossary/#validity-window).

## Applicability (explicit)
GTAF applies to **all delegation contexts** (low to high risk).  
Risk class determines **strictness**, not applicability.

## Structural orientation
GTAF is **artifact-centric**: artifacts are not documentation; they constitute the normative reality of decision authority, responsibility, and boundaries.

GTAF favors evidence-based, transparent, and reversible decisions.
